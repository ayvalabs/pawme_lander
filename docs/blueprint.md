- Background color: Light desaturated green (#F0FAF4) to keep the site airy and fresh.
- Accent color: Complementary light yellow (#FCE78D), slightly desaturated to add contrast and energy without overwhelming.
- Font pairing: 'Poppins' (sans-serif) for headings to maintain a contemporary style, and 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text to ensure readability.
- Employ simple, custom icons in a similar style to the logo. Favor outline-style icons colored using the primary and accent colors.
- Use a clean, modern layout with ample whitespace. Prioritize mobile-friendliness for users on various devices.
- Implement subtle animations on the landing page for visual engagement. For example, a gentle zoom or fade-in effect when scrolling to showcase PawMe's features.
